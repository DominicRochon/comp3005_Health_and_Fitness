# comp3005_Health_and_Fitness

My project report is here -> 3005FinalProjectReport.pdf

I have other pdf files for diagrams that are also in the repo.

To run the program do the following:

- Create a databse in pgAdmin named "HFClubDB"
- Open Health_Fitness_ManagementSystem.py and on line 6 adjust the "postGresPassword" value to whatever your postGres password is.
- run Health_Fitness_ManagementSystem.py
